                            living species, climate, weather and natural resources that affect human survival and
                            economic activities. The build environment are where humans have fundamentally transformed
                            landscapes such as urban settings and agricultural land conversion, the natural environment
                            is greatly changed into a simplified human environment. Though many animals build things to
                            provide a better environment for themselves, they are not human, hence beaver dams and the
                            works of mound-building termites are thought of as natural.

                        destruction. Hence, to save the environment and furthermore, protecting it, the best way is to
                        raise awareness of the people about the devastating situation that we’re in. We split education
                        into 3 categories base on their range of influence. The first and has the biggest impact is
                        academic education – the education that we receive in schools – because the majority of the
                        population go to school so this should be focus in the most. The second is propagation, this
                        method is used to teach the one that couldn’t go to school and to remind the one that have
                        already known about the environment. The third is guiding, just because this method is put in
                        third place doesn’t mean it is not important, it is because this is the next step. After the
                        people have learnt, understanded and willing to help, by then should we show them the way to
                        save and protect the environment properly. Finally, with out any further words, here are some
                        steps that could be done to educate the people:

                    <p class="text__description">In this section, we will focus on the government’s doing because they
                        are our biggest chance to deal significant damage in this war against environmental destruction:
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__description">+ Reduce the population growth rate. As a common sense, too much
                        people means needing more materials means damage the environment more. However, if the
                        population reduce too much, the nation will also suffer due to the lack of man power. So,
                        keeping it at the perfect rate is a tough but worth it job. In Viet Nam, there are the 2
                        children policy which had and have been proving its effectiveness.

                    </span>
                    <p class="text__description">+ The government also has standards to limit factory emissions as low
                        as possible so that climate change does not get worse. For example, for equipment that produces
                        fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, the amount of ammonia gas must not exceed 20 mg.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__description">+ Punishments for acts of environmental destruction are also something
                        that the government pays special attention to and has reasonable measures. For example, acts of
                        discharging waste that is harmful to the environment can be fined up to 3 billion VND or
                        imprisoned up to 7 years; or a fine from 70,000,000 VND to 100,000,000 VND for illegal
                        exploitation of from 15 m3 to less than 20 m3 of planted forest wood or from 07 m3 to less than
                        10 m3 of natural forest wood, imprisonment from 06 months up to 03 years for illegal
                        exploitation of from 10 m3 to less than 20 m3 of wood.
