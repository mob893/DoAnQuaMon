                        The status of noise pollution
                    </h3>
                    <p class="text__description-2">Noise pollution, or sound pollution, is the propagation of noise or
                        sound with potential harmful effects on humans and animals. The source of outdoor noise
                        worldwide is mainly caused by machines, transport and propagation systems. This is one of the
                        most serious problems in industrial and urban area. Noise pollution comes from many sources such
                        as: activities of traffic, industrial, constructions or entertainment; household; place of
                        interests; etc. In our opinion, the place where noise contamination is the worst is urban areas
                        because these are where people gather the most
                        There arenâ€™t a lot of numbers to show the status of noise pollution. However there is still one
                        reasearch according to the European Environment Agency, across Europe, it estimated 113 million
                        people (about one-fourth) are affected by road traffic noise levels above 55 decibels, the
                        threshold at which noise becomes harmful to human health by the WHO's definition.

                        The effects of noise pollution
                    </h3>
                    <p class="text__description-2">Chronic exposure to large noise (>85dB) can cause temporarily or even
                        pernamently deaf. In addition, the rate of heart diseases and blood pressure can vastly increase
                        because of it. Furthermore, noise at night can also cause insomia. Not only it affect us
                        physically but also mentally such as causing stress, reduce attention span and even depression.
                        Another impact of noise pollution is that it can confuse animals and ships, making them loose
                        sense of directions.
