                        The status of light pollution
                    </h3>
                    <p class="text__description-2">Light pollution is a kind of pollution that is solely artificial due
                        to the overwhelming amount of light created that make it turns detrimental to the environment
                        and to human ourselves. Light polution comes from many sources however, in our opinion, the main
                        cause is from urbanization as we consider light as an everyday necessity.

                    <p class="text__description-2">It has been estimated that 83 percent of the world's people live
                        under light-polluted skies and that 23 percent of the world's land area is affected by skyglow.
                        Studies show that urban areas are more at risk. Globally, it has increased by at least 49% from
                        1992 to 2017, also a new study published in Science reports that between 2011 and 2022, global
                        sky brightness increased by an estimated 9.6% per year.

                        The effects of light pollution
                    </h3>
                    <p class="text__description-2">To other species, light pollution change the behaviour of wild
                        animals especially nocturnal species such as: owl, bat, insects which can badly confound the
                        ecosystem. In a more specific case, it can confuse hatchlingsâ€™ direction after being borned.
                        To human health, light pollution is the leading cause of eyes disabilities. When in contact with
                        LED lights or blue light too much can retain the production of melatonin, and sleep control
                        hormones which cause insomia. In chronic contact with light at night can also cause stress,
                        depression and tiredness. Obesity, diabetes, heart diseases and even cancer surprisingly can
                        also come from long exposure to light. Finally and very obviously, light pollution is an
                        enormouse waste of resources and an enormous obstacle of astrology, it even block the beautiful
                        night sky.
