                        The status of water pollution
                    </h3>
                    <p class="text__description-2">The ocean is one of the most important ecosystems on the planet and a
                        very diverse ecosystem with over 230000 creatures which is approxiamately 80% life on Earth. In
                        addition, 70% of the oxygen that we breath comes from the ocean which is mainly made by seaweeds
                        and Cyanobacterias. In this day and age. The ocean is facing suffocation due to plastic
                        pollution, agricutural and industrial activities, oil spilling from ship transportation, mineral
                        and oil exploitaiton, climate change, inefficient tourism and fishery. In our opinion, plastic
                        pollution has the biggest impact on this because plastic is very difficult to decompose but are
                        use exceesively while reamaining a low cost making the situation worsen over time
                        Approximately 77 to 79 millions tons of plastic wastes floating somewhere on the ocean (Source:
                        The United Nations and other environment related organizations). About 80% of them come from
                        land and 20% come from ships and transportation activities. Annually, around 8 to 10 millions
                        tons of trash is pour to the waters such as lakes, rivers and directly to the ocean itself.
                        Researchers have found microplastic all across them and even in marine life. There are even sign
                        of plastic wastes in the Mariana trench â€“ the deepest point ever found in the ocean. Those
                        abovementioned proofs are showing that plastic wastes had and have been destroying the
                        environment badly, threatening the exsistence of many lives including humans.

                        The effects of water pollution
                    </h3>
                    <p class="text__description-2">To the ecosystem, water pollution causes the degradation of all
                        aquatic ecosystems, such as: fresh, coastal, and ocean waters. The specific contaminants leading
                        to pollution in water include a wide spectrum of chemicals, pathogens, and physical changes such
                        as: Oxygen-depleting substances may be natural materials such as plant matter as well as
                        human-made chemicals; other natural and anthropogenic substances may cause turbidity
                        (cloudiness) which blocks light and disrupts plant growth and clogs the gills of some fish
                        species.

                    <p class="text__description-2">To human health, water pollution causes waterborne diseases. A study
                        published in 2017 stated that "polluted water spread gastrointestinal diseases and parasitic
                        infections and killed 1.8 million people". Persistent exposure to pollutants through water are
                        environmental health hazards, which can increase the likelihood for one to develop cancer or
                        other diseases.

                    <p class="text__description-2">Ocean acidification is another impact of water pollution. Ocean
                        acidification is the ongoing decrease in the pH value of the Earth's oceans, caused by the
                        uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
                        Unproper fishery also contribute a lot to water pollution. Not only it affects the population of
                        marine life and the variety of species but also contaminate the water environment which stem
                        from fish corpses on fishing nets or due to dynamite fising or electic fishing.
