                    <p class="text__description-2">Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of
                        substances called pollutants in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and
                        other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials. There are many different
                        types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide,
                        nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic) and
                        biological molecules. Air pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural
                        phenomena. In our opinion, human activities are the one that deals more damage to the air and
                        for more specific, it is the use of fossil fuels and the process of uncontrolled
                        industrialization.

                    <p class="text__description-2">Air pollution is the largest environmental risk factor for disease
                        and premature death and the fourth largest risk factor overall for human health. Air pollution
                        causes the premature deaths of around 7 million people worldwide each year, or a global mean
                        loss of life expectancy (LLE) of 2.9 years. Outdoor air pollution attributable to fossil fuel
                        use alone causes ~3.61 million deaths annually, making it one of the top contributors to human
                        death. Anthropogenic ozone causes around 470,000 premature deaths a year and fine particulate
                        (PM2.5) pollution around another 2.1 million. In 2018, WHO estimated that "9 out of 10 people
                        breathe air containing high levels of pollutants‚Äù. Although the health consequences are
                        extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected.

                        even death; it can also harmful to other living organisms such as animals and crops. It is a
                        significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory
                        infections, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, and lung
                        cancer. Growing evidence suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ
                        scores, impaired cognition, increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression and
                        detrimental perinatal health. Air pollution is the largest environmental risk factor for disease
                        and premature death and the fourth largest risk factor overall for human health.

                        sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and 2.5PM (particulate matter) could damage the air quality. The
                        act of exploiting oil, gas and coal also destroy ecosystems and deplete natural resources. In
