                    <p class="text__description-2">We, the human, mostly lives on land. Hence the pollution made on land
                        will directly affect us. Soil pollution is caused by several reason such as: plastic pollution;
                        mining activities; extensive farming; agrochemicals such as: pesticides, herbicides and
                        fertilizers; contruction activities; waste disposals such as: nuclear wastes, household wastes,
                        industrial wastes, landfills, sewage, etc. In our opinion, agricultural and industrial
                        activities have the biggest impact on this because those are essentials in society development
                        and the one that are focused on and invested in the most.

                    <p class="text__description-2">An example about unproper agricutural acts could be seen in China â€“
                        the factory of the world. The immense and sustained growth of the People's Republic of China
                        since the 1970s has exacted a price from the land in increased soil pollution. According to a
                        scientific sampling, 100,000 square kilometres of China's cultivated land have been polluted,
                        with contaminated water being used to irrigate a further 21,670 square kilometres and another
                        1,300 square kilometres covered or destroyed by solid wastes. In total, the area accounts for
                        one-tenth of China's cultivatable land, and is mostly in economically developed areas.

                    <p class="text__description-2">Another example, this time, about unproper industrial acts could be
                        seen in the European Union where the number of estimated potential contaminated sites is more
                        than 2.5 millions and the identified contaminated sites are around 342 thousands. Municipal and
                        industrial wastes contribute most to soil contamination (38%), followed by the
                        industrial/commercial sector (34%). Mineral oil and heavy metals are the main contaminants
                        contributing around 60% to soil contamination.

                        The effects of soil pollution
                    </h3>
                    <p class="text__description-2">To the ecosystem, there are radical soil chemistry changes which can
                        arise from the presence of many hazardous chemicals even at low concentration of the contaminant
                        species. These changes can manifest in the alteration of metabolism of endemic microorganisms
                        and arthropods resident in a given soil environment. The result can be virtual eradication of
                        some of the primary food chain, which in turn could have major consequences for predator or
                        consumer species. In argricultural contaminants typically alter plant metabolism, often causing
                        a reduction in crop yields. This has a secondary effect upon soil conservation, since the
                        languishing crops cannot shield the Earth's soil from erosion.

                    <p class="text__description-2">To human health, exposure to soil contamination vary greatly
                        depending on pollutant type, the pathway of attack, and the vulnerability of the exposed
                        population. For example: chronic exposure to chromium, lead, and other metals, petroleum,
                        solvents, and many pesticide and herbicide formulations can be carcinogenic, can cause
                        congenital disorders, or can cause other chronic health conditions; chronic exposure to benzene
                        at sufficient concentrations is known to be associated with a higher incidence of leukemia;
                        mercury and cyclodienes are also known to induce higher incidences of kidney damage and some
                        irreversible diseases.
